# Limitations : 
Throughout the data querying process, we encountered a total of 967 records with negative ages, which were subsequently omitted from our analysis. Our focus was solely on employees aged 18 years and above. Additionally, a subset of termination dates exhibited unrealistically distant future dates, totaling 1599 records, which were not factored into our examination. Furthermore, we opted to restrict our analysis to termination dates up until the current date.
